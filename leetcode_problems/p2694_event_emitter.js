// Design an EventEmitter class. This interface is similar (but with some differences) to the one found in Node.js
//  or the Event Target interface of the DOM.
// The EventEmitter should allow for subscribing to events and emitting them.
// Your EventEmitter class should have the following two methods:
//  - subscribe - This method takes in two arguments: the name of an event as a string and a callback function.
//    This callback function will later be called when the event is emitted.
//    An event should be able to have multiple listeners for the same event.
//    When emitting an event with multiple callbacks, each should be called in the order in which they were subscribed.
//    An array of results should be returned. You can assume no callbacks passed to subscribe are referentially identical.
//    The subscribe method should also return an object with an unsubscribe method that enables the user to unsubscribe.
//    When it is called, the callback should be removed from the list of subscriptions and undefined should be returned.
//  - emit - This method takes in two arguments: the name of an event as a string and an optional array of arguments
//    that will be passed to the callback(s). If there are no callbacks subscribed to the given event, return an empty array.
//    Otherwise, return an array of the results of all callback calls in the order they were subscribed.
// ------------------------------------
// 1 <= actions.length <= 10
// values.length === actions.length
// All test cases are valid, e.g. you don't need to handle scenarios when unsubscribing from a non-existing subscription.
// There are only 4 different actions: EventEmitter, emit, subscribe, and unsubscribe.
// The EventEmitter action doesn't take any arguments.
// The emit action takes between either 1 or 2 arguments. The first argument is the name of the event we want to emit,
//  and the 2nd argument is passed to the callback functions.
// The subscribe action takes 2 arguments, where the first one is the event name and the second is the callback function.
// The unsubscribe action takes one argument, which is the 0-indexed order of the subscription made before.
